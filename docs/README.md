# Kagenti Documentation

This directory contains the official Kagenti project documentation. 

## Getting Started

If you are new to Kagenti, we recommend the following flow to get started with a local Kind cluster. 

1. [Installation Guide](./install.md): Step-by-step instructions to start a Kind cluster and install all prerequisite components
2. [Quickstart Weather Agent](https://github.com/kagenti/kagenti-extensions/blob/main/AuthBridge/demos/weather-agent/demo-ui.md): Deploy your first agent with AuthBridge security.

Kagenti is built on existing open-source cloud-native technologies. 

- [Architecture Overview](./tech-details.md) gives a high-level look at the existing technologies. 

## Demos and Tutorials

## Core Concepts

Through this incubation project, we have identified several core components: 

- [MCP Gateway](./gateway.md) offers a quickstart to using the MCP Gateway. You may also find more information in [our mcp-gateway repo](https://github.com/kagenti/mcp-gateway).
- [Identity and Security](./identity-guide.md) provides deeper overview on the various security tools that help implement zero-trust security from the platform level. 

## Develop with Kagenti

This repo provides a UI to interface with the operator and deployed agents and tools.

- [Developer Environment Guides](./developer/README.md) - Setup guides for Kind, HyperShift, and Claude Code workflows
- [Developer's Guide](./dev-guide.md) provides instructions to get started contributing to the Kagenti UI
